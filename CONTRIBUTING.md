## Code of Conduct

Please read [the `alphagov` CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/alphagov/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Conventions to follow

### Indentation and whitespace

2-space, soft-tabs only. No trailing whitespace. The repository contains an .editorconfig file to enforce this if your editor supports this.

### Coding style

We follow the style conventions detailed in [the GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/manuals/programming-languages.html).

## Supported browsers

TODO: Add browser support, once we know what we're supporting. For now, let's assume that we're using [the Service Manual's browsers to test in](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices).

## Supported assistive technology

TODO: Add assistive technology support, once we know what we're supporting. For now, let's assume that we're using [the Service Manual's assistive technologies to test with](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies).

## Commit hygiene

Please see our [Git style guide in the 'How to store source code' page of the GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/source-code.html#commit-messages), which describes how we prefer Git history and commit messages to read.
