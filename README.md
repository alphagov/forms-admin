# GOV.UK Forms Admin

GOV.UK Forms is a service for creating forms. GOV.UK Forms Admin is a an application to handle the administration, design and publishing of those forms. It's a Ruby on Rails application built on a PostgreSQL database.

## Before you start

To run the project you will need to install:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - we use version 3 of Ruby. Before running the project, double check the [.ruby-version] file to see the exact version.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - the frontend build requires Node.js. We use Node 16 LTS versions.
- a running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - we use Yarn rather than `npm` to install and run the frontend.

We recommend using a version manager to install and manage these, such as:

- [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) for Ruby
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js
- [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) for both
