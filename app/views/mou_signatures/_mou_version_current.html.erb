  <li>
    <p>
      This is a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) between the Government Digital Service (“GDS”) and your organisation (together the
      “Parties”). The single MOU covers all the forms an organisation publishes using GOV.UK Forms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This MOU shall be interpreted in accordance with the Annexes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This MOU is not intended to be legally binding and no legal obligations or legal rights shall arise between the Parties from the
      provisions of the MOU. For the avoidance of doubt, GDS shall not be liable for any Loss arising from, or in connection with a breach
      of this MOU. However, the Parties enter into the MOU intending to honour their obligations. Any dispute will be escalated to
      appropriately senior officers of GDS and your organisation for resolution.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about-gov.uk-forms">About GOV.UK Forms</h2>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="4">
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Forms</a> is a web-based platform owned and operated by GDS, which is used for
      creating more accessible online forms for GOV.UK without needing technical knowledge. As well as the forms being more accessible
      compared to document-based forms like PDFs, the forms are easier to use and quicker for government teams to process.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When your organisation creates online forms, at your request, GOV.UK Forms collects information from members of the public and
      businesses. As GOV.UK Forms processes the Personal Data from members of the public and businesses on behalf of your organisation, GDS
      is a Data Processor for your organisation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When GOV.UK Forms processes completed forms, GDS sends the Personal Data of members of the public and businesses to your organisation.
      GDS uses GOV.UK Notify to deliver emails with the personal data submissions to your organisation’s Form Processors. This MOU covers
      this transfer.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The online forms are unauthenticated and could be completed by anyone. You are responsible for including identification and
      authentication mechanisms within your downstream processes if these are required.

      The GOV.UK Forms team designs and develops the GOV.UK Forms web platform. Your organisation gets access to and creates online forms
      using the GOV.UK Forms platform. Your organisation’s form creators create online forms using the GOV.UK Forms platform, which runs on
      an external cloud service. Members of the public and businesses fill in a form on GOV.UK Forms. GOV.UK Forms collects the Personal
      Data and uses an API to deliver the Personal Data to GOV.UK Notify. GOV.UK Notify, using an external email provider, delivers the
      personal data to your organisation’s shared inbox for your Form Processor to use.

  <li>
    <p>
      This agreement starts when your organisation has ‘Organisation Admin’ accounts on the GOV.UK Forms platform. Either GDS or your
      organisation can end this agreement by giving three months’ notice by email.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The agreement covers all users within the organisation that will use GOV.UK Forms. The agreement can be agreed by multiple users in
      the same organisation, who will be informed of changes as per below.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any updates to this agreement will be emailed to the person who agreed on behalf of your organisation (or the first account in your
      organisation that is still active). This will happen 30 calendar days before any change is due to be made, along with a summary of the
      changes. The changes will then take effect on the date specified in the notification email. No action is required by your organisation
      if you accept the changes.

    <p>If your organisation doesn’t wish to accept the change, you must notify GDS and this MOU will terminate with immediate effect.</p>

      GDS reserves the right to refuse to host, or to cease hosting forms and to delete them from the platform and remove links from GOV.UK

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="18">
  <li>
    <p>
      There is currently no cost for using GOV.UK Forms or for the hosting of forms made on the platform. This is intended to help reduce
      the barriers to lower volume services using GOV.UK Forms that would otherwise require significant procurement effort. This will help
      drive greater digitisation of government services and promote channel shift, saving money and time for our users.
    </p>

  <li>
    <p>
      If this pricing structure should change in the future, GDS will inform your organisation at least six months before any price changes
      so that you can decide whether to continue using the product.

  Annex D: GOV.UK Forms schedule of processing, personal data and data subjects
</h2>
<p>
  Annex D provides a general description of how GOV.UK Forms will process Personal Data on behalf of your organisation as controller. The
  Annex will be supplemented by the content of the forms your organisation creates using the GOV.UK Forms platform, and this content will
  constitute your further documented instructions as to how GDS may process personal data on your behalf for the purposes of Article
  28(3)(a) of UK GDPR.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="subject-matter-of-the-processing">Subject matter of the Processing</h3>
<p>
  To support the running of government services, GOV.UK Forms collects Personal and Non-Personal Data from members of the public and
  businesses so that your organisation can make decisions about them.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="duration-of-the-processing">Duration of the Processing</h3>
<p>
  Processing on the GOV.UK Forms infrastructure takes up to 2 days (to allow for disaster recovery). When submitted, Form Data is securely
  passed to the GOV.UK Notify application, also run by GDS. Processing by GOV.UK Notify is typically completed within 7 days.
</p>
<p>
  Third party suppliers that distribute the notifications for GOV.UK Notify will retain the data for up to 12 months for audit and billing
  purposes.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="nature-and-purposes-of-the-processing">Nature and purposes of the Processing</h3>
<p>GOV.UK Forms collects Personal Data for the purposes of Processing forms that are submitted by members of the public and businesses.</p>
<p>
  GOV.UK Forms also collects Personal Data for the purposes of monitoring and alerting on application performance and platform security.
</p>
<p>GOV.UK Forms uses third party suppliers to deliver emails to your organisation and to manage customer support.</p>
<p>Once the relevant retention period has been reached, GOV.UK Forms Personal Data is deleted by GDS and third party suppliers.</p>
<p>
  The purposes of government forms are many and varied, but generally fall into the categories of licences, permits, registrations,
  reporting, taxation, refunds, requesting support, renewals, records changes, exemptions, appeals, correspondence, public engagement and
  procurement.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="types-of-personal-data">Types of Personal Data</h3>
<p>
  The types of Personal Data collected in government forms will be dependent on the form that has been provided, but generally will include
  name, identification number, location data and other data that could identify an individual both directly or indirectly.
</p>
<p>
  Where needed for the service, forms may also collect special category data and information relating to criminal convictions and offences.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="categories-of-data-subject">Categories of Data Subject</h3>
<p>Includes members of the public and people employed by businesses or other organisations.</p>

  Plan for return or destruction of the data once the Processing is complete, unless required under union or member state Law to preserve
  that type of data
</h3>
<p>
  Personal Data is automatically deleted at the end of the data retention period, which for GOV.UK Forms and its third party providers
  ranges between 7 days and 2 years (see data retention periods above). This is the case as part of routine Processing, and at termination
  of this Agreement.
</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="annex-e-how-gov.uk-forms-protects-your-data">Annex E: How GOV.UK Forms protects your data</h2>
<p>
  This section provides an overview of the security measures provided by the GOV.UK Forms service. It is intended to assist you with
  deciding whether the service is suitable for your needs.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Hosting</h3>
<p>
  GOV.UK Forms is hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> in their London Region. Data is stored within AWS Relational Database
  Service with frequent backups. All components have built in redundancy where possible..
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Service design</h3>
<p>
  GOV.UK Forms has been designed to align with government cyber security standards, including
  <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/standards/cyber_standard">The Cyber Security Standard</a>, the
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a>
  and relevant guidance published by the NCSC, the UK’s national authority for cyber security.
</p>
<p>Threat modelling and risk assessments are used to identify where additional security measures may be necessary.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Personnel security controls</h3>
<p>
  Operations staff within GDS and its supply chain who support GOV.UK Forms are required to successfully complete pre-employment screening
  in accordance with the Baseline Personnel Security Standard or an equivalent commercial screening process.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Separation between customers</h3>
<p>
  Organisations can only create and edit their own forms, except where an organisation agrees to a member of another organisation creating
  and editing forms on its behalf. For example, a ‘parent’ organisation creating and editing forms on behalf of a ‘child’ organisation.
  GOV.UK Forms team members have ‘Super Admin’ account access, which means that they (and only they) are able to see, create and edit all
  forms in all organisations, for the purpose of oversight and support.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Use of Notify</h3>
<p>
  GOV.UK Forms uses the
  <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/features/security">GOV.UK Notify service</a>
  to deliver form response data to your organisation via email messages.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Protection of data in transit</h3>
<p>Within GOV.UK Forms, form response data will be encrypted in transit as follows:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <p>Between citizens’ browsers and online forms, by using TLS V1.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between your users’ browsers and the GOV.UK Forms administration interface, by using TLS V1.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Between GOV.UK Forms and its 3rd party processors, by using TLS V1.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Between Notify and your designated mailbox for receiving submitted form responses, by using TLS V1.2 if your mail server supports this
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Protection of data at rest</h3>
<p>
  Form response data will be encrypted at rest using
  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/at-rest-encryption.html"
    >AWS At-Rest Encryption in ElastiCache for Redis</a
  >
  whilst it is being temporarily stored by GOV.UK Forms.
</p>
<p>Amazon RDS PostgreSQL is used to store form configuration and user account details.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Vulnerability management</h3>
<p>
  Software code is subject to security testing during the software development process and the production environment is subject to
  continuous vulnerability scanning using
  <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/web-check">NCSC’s Web Check</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The service is subject to independent penetration testing at least annually and prior to major functional feature releases. Any findings
  are risk assessed and managed in accordance with GDS’s risk appetite.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Event logging and protective monitoring</h3>
<p>
  GDS generates and retains event logs of the systems and applications that deliver GOV.UK Forms and the service is protectively monitored
  for indicators of compromise.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Governance</h3>
<p>
  During its development, GOV.UK Forms was subject to independent service assessments. In addition, GDS Information Assurance maintains an
  independent information risk assessment of the service, reporting to the GDS Senior Leadership Team.
