<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>
    <p>
      This is a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) between the Government Digital Service (“GDS”) and your organisation (together the
      “Parties”). The single MOU covers all the forms an organisation publishes using GOV.UK Forms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This MOU shall be interpreted in accordance with the Annexes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This MOU is not intended to be legally binding and no legal obligations or legal rights shall arise between the Parties from the
      provisions of the MOU. For the avoidance of doubt, GDS shall not be liable for any Loss arising from, or in connection with a breach
      of this MOU. However, the Parties enter into the MOU intending to honour their obligations. Any dispute will be escalated to
      appropriately senior officers of GDS and your organisation for resolution.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="about-gov.uk-forms">About GOV.UK Forms</h2>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" start="4">
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Forms</a>
      is a web-based platform owned and operated by GDS, which is used for easily creating online forms on GOV.UK.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The GOV.UK Forms team within GDS develops, maintains and runs the GOV.UK Forms platform. Your organisation gets access to the GOV.UK
      Forms platform, where form creators can create and manage online forms.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When your organisation creates online forms, at your request, GOV.UK Forms collects information from members of the public and
      businesses. As GOV.UK Forms processes the Personal Data from members of the public and businesses on behalf of your organisation, GDS
      is a Data Processor for your organisation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When GOV.UK Forms processes completed forms, GDS transfers the Personal Data of members of the public and businesses to your
      organisation using the delivery method configured for the form. This MOU covers this transfer.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

      This agreement starts when a user agrees to the MOU on behalf of their organisation. Either GDS or your organisation can end
      this agreement by giving three months’ notice by email.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The agreement covers all users within the organisation that will use GOV.UK Forms. The agreement can be agreed by multiple users in
      the same organisation, who will be informed of changes as per below.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Any updates to this agreement will be emailed to the person who agreed on behalf of your organisation (or the first account in your
      organisation that is still active). This will happen 7 calendar days before any change is due to be made, along with a summary of the
      changes. The changes will then take effect on the date specified in the notification email. No action is required by your organisation
      if you accept the changes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your organisation doesn’t wish to accept the change, you must notify GDS and this MOU will terminate with immediate effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      GDS reserves the right to refuse to host, or to cease hosting forms and to delete them from the platform and remove links from GOV.UK,
      where in GDS’s reasonable opinion publishing the forms would:

  GOV.UK Forms is hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> in their London Region. All components have built in redundancy and
  backups where possible.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Service design</h3>
<p>
  GOV.UK Forms has been designed to align with government cyber security standards, including
  <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/standards/cyber_standard">The Cyber Security Standard</a>, the
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a>

  Operations staff within GDS and its supply chain who support GOV.UK Forms are required to successfully complete pre-employment screening
  in accordance with the Baseline Personnel Security Standard or an equivalent commercial screening process.
