        heading: Bulleted lists
        instructions: |
          To add bullet points, start each item with * (asterisk) or - (dash). Make sure there is one space after the asterisk or dash.

          Leave one empty line before adding the first bullet point and another after the last bullet point. For example:
      formatting_help_section_heading: Formatting help
      headings:
        heading: Headings
        instructions: |
          Use the headings in sequence - a second-level heading needs to come before a third-level heading.

          Do not use headings to style your text in bold. This can cause issues for people using assistive technology.

          Use numbers for each list item, followed by a full stop. Make sure there is one space after the full stop.

          Leave one empty line before adding the first list item and another after the last list item. For example:
      second_level_headings:
        example: "## This is a second-level heading"
        heading: Second-level headings
        instructions: 'To add a second-level heading (H2), use 2 hashtags followed by a space. For example:'
