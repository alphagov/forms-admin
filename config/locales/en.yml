          When someone has answered all the questions in
          your form, they’ll be shown a page that lists all of their answers.
          The page will ask them to check their answers before they submit the
          form.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add a declaration to this page. A declaration is a statement
          that people must confirm they understand and agree to before they
          submit the form.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might want to add a declaration if you need people to confirm they
          have provided accurate information, or that they understand the
          consequences of providing false information.

        instructions: |
          To add bullet points, start each item with * (asterisk) or - (dash). Make sure there is one space after the asterisk or dash.

          Leave one empty line before adding the first bullet point and another after the last bullet point. For example:
      formatting_help_section_heading: Formatting help
      headings:
        heading: Headings
        instructions: |
          Use the headings in sequence - a second-level heading needs to come before a third-level heading.

          Do not use headings to style your text in bold. This can cause issues for people using assistive technology.
      links:
        example: "[Link text](https://www.gov.uk/link-text-url)"
        heading: Links and URLs
        instructions: 'To add a link, use square brackets [ ] around the link text, and round brackets ( ) around the full URL. Make sure there are no spaces between the two sets of brackets. For example:'
      numbered_lists:
        example: |
          1. First item
          2. Second item
          3. Third item
        heading: Numbered lists
        instructions: |
          Use numbers for each list item, followed by a full stop. Make sure there is one space after the full stop.

          Leave one empty line before adding the first list item and another after the last list item. For example:
      second_level_headings:
        example: "## This is a second-level heading"
        heading: Second-level headings
        instructions: 'To add a second-level heading (H2), use 2 hashtags followed by a space. For example:'
      third_level_headings:
        example: "### This is a third-level heading"
        heading: Third-level headings
        instructions: 'To add a third-level heading (H3), use 3 hashtags followed by a space. For example:'

          <li>your organisation is ok with form responses being emailed individually to the team email address you provide (we’re planning to support other ways of receiving form submissions, but they’re not available yet)</li>
          <li>you’ll only use GOV.UK Forms to make forms to be published on the GOV.UK website - not on other websites or for other uses such as internal forms or surveys</li>
          <li>you do not expect any of the forms you’re planning to make to get more than 10,000 submissions a year</li>
          <li>you’re happy to be asked for feedback and to take part in user research</li>
