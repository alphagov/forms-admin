          When someone has answered all the questions in
          your form, they’ll be shown a page that lists all of their answers.
          The page will ask them to check their answers before they submit the
          form.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add a declaration to this page. A declaration is a statement
          that people must confirm they understand and agree to before they
          submit the form.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might want to add a declaration if you need people to confirm they
          have provided accurate information, or that they understand the
          consequences of providing false information.

        instructions: |
          To add bullet points, start each item with * (asterisk) or - (dash). Make sure there is one space after the asterisk or dash.

        <p>GOV.UK Forms adds a unique 8-character reference to each form submission.</p>

        <p>When creating a payment link in GOV.UK Pay, you’ll be asked “Do your users already have a payment reference?”</p>

        <p>Select “Yes”.</p>

        <p>This means the form reference number will automatically be sent through to GOV.UK Pay when someone makes a payment.</p>

        <p>When asked to fill in the “Name of payment reference” field, enter “Form reference number”.</p>

        <p>GOV.UK Forms is in the early stages of development, so it will not be suitable for all types of form at the moment.</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you’ve tried out the form builder and you’re confident you can create your forms using <a href="https://www.forms.service.gov.uk/features" class="govuk-link">the limited features available</a> at the moment</li>
          <li>your organisation is ok with form responses being emailed individually to the team email address you provide (we’re planning to support other ways of receiving form submissions, but they’re not available yet)</li>
          <li>you’ll only use GOV.UK Forms to make forms to be published on the GOV.UK website - not on other websites or for other uses such as internal forms or surveys</li>
          <li>you do not expect any of the forms you’re planning to make to get more than 10,000 submissions a year</li>
          <li>you’re happy to be asked for feedback and to take part in user research</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you meet these requirements, we’ll email you to ask for a bit more information. We’ll then get in touch to discuss the next steps.</p>
